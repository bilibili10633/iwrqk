## ðŸ’» Contributions

If you are a developer eager to contribute to this project, feel free to submit a pull request! The project also utilizes `slang` for localization, and [contributions to translation](/lib/i18n/strings.i18n.json) are appreciated.

In case you come across any bugs, please report them after ensuring they are not caused by network issues, as Iwara's servers may encounter errors.

Let's collaborate to enhance the Iwara experience together!
